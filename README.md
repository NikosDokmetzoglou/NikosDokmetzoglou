### Welcome to my GitHub page!

My name is Nikos Dokmetzoglou and I am a physics PhD candidate at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/), studying symmetry properties of scalar and gauge field theories and their scattering amplitudes.

You can find more about me and my research by visiting my [personal website](https://tarheels.live/nikosdokmetzoglou/) 
or my [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1520-8758) and [INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1808352) profiles.

I will soon be uploading some Mathematica packages that I built while working on my [latest research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14806).
