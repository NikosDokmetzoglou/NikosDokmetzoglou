### Welcome to my GitHub page!

My name is Nikos Dokmetzoglou and I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Nuclear and Particle Physics of the [National Centre of Scientific Research "Demokritos"](http://www.inp.demokritos.gr/). 

<!--
I am interested in the symmetry properties of scalar and gauge field theories and their scattering amplitudes.

I will soon be uploading some Mathematica packages that I built while working on my [latest research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14806).
